# Base Configuration

This repository contains the base configuration for my Arch installation.
It contains some quality of life improvement aliases & scripts, as well as the
essentials (such as `dwm`, `dmenu`).

It is recommended to clone this to the `~/.config` directory and then add
`source ~/.config/base/cfg` to the `.zshrc` (or equivalent) file.
